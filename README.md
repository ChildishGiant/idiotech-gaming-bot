# idiotech-gaming-bot
The bot used for irritating the members of Idiotech's Discord server. https://discord.gg/0z3KQXI6apyyeNOD


If you want to develop/test locally you'll need a bot user token from [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro). Create a new file in the root folder, named `token.txt` and paste your token in.

To install discord.py do `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py`. All other libs should be bundled with python3

Inviting bots is a bit of a hassle right now. You need to make a link to give the server owner. The format is as such:
`https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=CLIENTID&scope=bot&permissions=478208` if you want the bot to have different permissions there is a nifty calculator located [here](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html).
